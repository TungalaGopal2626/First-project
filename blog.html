His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes."[70][71] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007).
